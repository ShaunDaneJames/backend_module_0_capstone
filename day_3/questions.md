## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement produce binary true and false results.

If it is snowing, I will wear a jacket.

If Number of different cheese I know >= 3
  puts "You may know your cheese!"
elsif Number of different cheese I know == 2
  puts "So you know a couple of cheeses."
else
  puts "That's ok cheese isn't for everyone."
end   


1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
I've been racking my brain on this one. If a conditional statement is returning a true or false value, what other uses are there other than determining which path to take based off the results.
