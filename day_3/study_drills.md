1) What do you think the if does to the code under it?
The if statements seems to run a check. Check to see the following is true, or not, and take the appropriate action.

2)Why does the code under the if need to be indented two spaces?
This indentation not only makes the code easier to read, but it is also for syntax purposes. You should be able to see where the if statement applies according to the spacing.

3)What happens if it isn't indented?
I wasn't sure so I tried it, apparently it doesn't break anything but it would make your code very hard to read.

4) Can you put other boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the if-statement? Try it.
Yes!

5) What happens if you change the initial values for people, cats, and dogs?
Changing the values determine which if statements trigger. The values I changed it to lead to the results that the world is covered in drool and it is doomed due to all the cats.
