Exercises:
1) If you had an array of numbers, e.g. [1,2,3,4], how do you print out the doubles of each number? Triples?

irb(main):004:0> list.each {|list| puts list * 2}
2
4
6
8
=> [1, 2, 3, 4]

2)If you had the same array, how would you only print out the even numbers? What about the odd numbers?

3)How could you create a new array which contains each number multipled by 2?

irb(main):003:0> array.each {|array| puts array * 2}
10
12
14
16
=> [5, 6, 7, 8]
irb(main):004:0>

4)Given an array of first and last names, e.g. [“Alice Smith”, “Bob Evans”, “Roy Rogers”], how would you print out the full names line by line?
