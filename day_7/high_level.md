## Checker board

If we require user input we will be using the .get method and potentially converting it to an integer.

We will now have to define how the board will be formed. Creating this method would incorporate the use of new lines, X's, as well as the font size of the X's.  This method will use the value provided by the user to adjust the font size.


## Ceasar Cipher

We'd begin by prompting the user for the message to encode. I believe we will need an array with the alphabet for reference. We will also need a shift or encode method that will alter each element in the array so it will correspond with a new letter. Finally, the new message will be printed out according to the shift value.
